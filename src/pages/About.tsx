              Meteor Addon List is a collection of addons for the Meteor Client,
              automatically scraped from GitHub. Itâ€™s designed to make
              discovering, and downloading addons as seamless as possible.

            <p>
              This project was heavily inspired by AntiCope. While it was a
              great resource, it lacked advanced filtering, search
              functionality, and regular updates. Meteor Addon List is built to
              fix those issues.
